Description: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Monitors dsl lines and it's parameters, categorizes them, chooses
appropriate action if needed (profile(s) change, line reset ..) and schedules
actions.

Modules
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dslam ports err: script that should be scheduled in cron for every six hours,
evaluates dsl line errors parameters, and puts each line in one of the 
category. Categories: green (no errors), yellow (few errors, could be 
annulated with error correction system), orange (there are some errors which
could impact QoE, red (serious impact on QoE) and black (this is hardly
working).

Dslam ports lols: should be scheduled for every six hours, evaluated loss of 
line events and categorizes each line. Categories: green, yellow, orange, red,
black. Have the same meaning as for previous module.

Dslam port status: As each line was given a category for six hour intervals,
this script evaluates 6 hour intervals for errors and lols in the past 7 days,
and makes decision based on these intervals. Decision could be, similar as
above, green, yellow, orange, red, black.

Dsl line manager: module that takes into account current dsl line parameters,
evaluated statuses from above, and services that user pays and makes decision
about actions that should be taken on dsl line. Goal is to apply protection 
mechanism for errored ports (especially iptv ports), to decrease output power 
and increase maximum attainable rate where possible.
