Description
Some dslam boards can perform Metallic Line Test (MELT). This application can,
upon receving request through JSON RPC interface, start the MELT test by
sending SNMP request to dslam. Dslam will then perform melt line testing on 
port, and send results in SNMP trap. Another application, trap-handler, will 
receive snmp request and save results in the redis cache, ready for further 
processing.
